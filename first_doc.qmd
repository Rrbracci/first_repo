## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

```{r}
dim(cars)
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
plot(x = cars$dist, y = cars$speed)
lm1 <- lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)
```

```{r}
summary(lm1)
```

```{r}
plot(cars)
abline(lm1)
```
